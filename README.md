# DeepLearning
This repo contains information, details and files such as code files related to Deep Learning.

There are 3 open-source code notebooks available on Deep Learning:

1. Digits Recognition using Deep Learning on MNIST dataset (Convolutional Neural Network / CNN).
2. Image Classification using Deep Learning on Fashion-MNIST dataset (Convolutional Neural Network / CNN).
3. Binary Classification on Pima-Indian-Diabetes dataset (Deep Neural Network / DNN).
