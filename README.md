# DeepLearning
This repo contains information, details and files such as code files related to Deep Learning.

There are 4 open-source code notebooks available on Deep Learning:

1. Digits Recognition using Deep Learning on MNIST dataset (Convolutional Neural Network / CNN).
2. Image Classification using Deep Learning on Fashion-MNIST dataset (Convolutional Neural Network / CNN).
3. Binary Classification on Pima-Indian-Diabetes dataset (Deep Neural Network / DNN).
4. Traffic Signs Image Classification using Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Network / CNN).

Sources of dataset (1, 2: MNIST dataset; 3, 4: Available on Kaggle)

`All notebooks show improvement in performance over many other implementations (excluding state-of-the-art), and can be run on commodity or readily available hardware.`
