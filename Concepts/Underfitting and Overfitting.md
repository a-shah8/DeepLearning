## Underfitting and Overfitting

**Underfitting**

    Underfitting occurs when the model is not able to obtain a sufficiently low error value on the training set.

**Overfitting**

    Overfitting occurs when the gap between the training error and test error is too large. 
    This means the model is memorizing properties of the training set and hence, 
    possibly won't perform well on any unseen data.

_This is as simple as it can get._

_I recommend the readers to google 'Unfitting' and 'Overfitting', and read the most appropriate articles to understand more._
